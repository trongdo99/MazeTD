### **A Pathfinding Implementation in a Tower Defense Game in Unity**

This study project focuses on learning and implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm within a Tower Defense game built in Unity. The primary goal is to enable dynamic pathfinding for enemy units, allowing them to intelligently recalculate and navigate alternate routes when the original path to the objective is obstructed by player-placed towers in real time.

In addition to the gameplay mechanics, the project also serves as a platform to explore and practice custom tool development within the Unity Editor. These tools streamline the process of designing and configuring new towers, enemy types, and other game elements, improving workflow efficiency and maintainability during development.

Key learning objectives include:

 - Implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm from scratch.

 - Handling real-time path updates in response to dynamic environmental changes.

 - Creating custom Unity Editor tools for rapid content creation and iteration.
